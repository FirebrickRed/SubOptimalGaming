about: Do I play games because I'm good? Hell no. Do I play games because I
  enjoy the fresh, toxic atmosphere? Possibly. But the reason I keep turning on
  that console and putting on that headset, is really because of the assholes on
  my friends list. Plus, someone needs to keep those hooligans in check.
