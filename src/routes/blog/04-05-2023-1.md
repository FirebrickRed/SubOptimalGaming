  t﻿his should just be a paragraph text. with lots of words. and sentinces for comparason between all the awful spelling cuz this isn't going to work anyways so I'm going to have to do some research to figure out how this is going to work. But just in case **bold text should be here** which looks like that works now lets try *doing the italic stuff* which also looks to be working
